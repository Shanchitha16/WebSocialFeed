# WebSocialFeed 🐦

**WebSocialFeed** is a basic, browser-based social media feed simulation created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It mimics a simplified version of a Twitter-like timeline where posts are displayed dynamically.

You can click the **"Load More"** button to simulate loading more posts, just like scrolling through real social apps.  
This project is a great way to understand how feeds work — without needing a real server or database.
